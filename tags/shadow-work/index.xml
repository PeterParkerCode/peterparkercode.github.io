      <description>About two years ago, I was in a separation with this girl that I liked, which was sadly cut off too shortly after major agendas were taking place around the world. A lot of grief, mourning, heartbreak took place with a lot elephants in the room needing to be addressed between me and her, as I tried to reach out to her, though she became very distant, closed off and avoided me.</description>

      <description>I keep running away from the things that I need to face, being attached on with the past and I can&amp;rsquo;t run and hide forever. Made a lot of mistakes with that connection that could&amp;rsquo;ve been something but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t mean&amp;rsquo;t to be. I&amp;rsquo;m still learning on how to move forward from it, which is still a challenge for me, reminsing about the times I had with her, mourning on what I lost.</description>
