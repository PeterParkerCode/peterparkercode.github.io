      <description>here we are
my scars turned into actual Love Stars
this time,
it isn&amp;rsquo;t love that is unrequited
but it&amp;rsquo;s very alive and excited
like a hero in the night skyscraper
I want to take that leap of faith
and become greater
maybe soulmates aren&amp;rsquo;t found
but are created
it was worth the pain and the waiting
I know we&amp;rsquo;re scared
you&amp;rsquo;ve promised that you&amp;rsquo;ll never hurt me
and never abandon or flee</description>

      <description>this tension is building up inside of me
to the point where I donâ€™t know how to explain it within me
something about us sparked a flame that I would never forget
too bad we never commit, I think deep down is what we regret
I just wanna hug you tight
fight for you right by your side
close off the outside world
as we run in the beautiful night</description>
