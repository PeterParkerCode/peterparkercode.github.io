      <description>here we are my scars turned into actual Love Stars this time, it isn&amp;rsquo;t love that is unrequited but it&amp;rsquo;s very alive and excited like a hero in the night skyscraper I want to take that leap of faith and become greater maybe soulmates aren&amp;rsquo;t found but are created it was worth the pain and the waiting I know we&amp;rsquo;re scared you&amp;rsquo;ve promised that you&amp;rsquo;ll never hurt me and never abandon or flee as I promised that I&amp;rsquo;ll still love you even if we get old long distance as of this moment but I still wanna wrap my arms around you and hold we maybe physically far but so energetically close time don&amp;rsquo;t exist when I talk to you the clocks become completely froze a new story is about to be told I&amp;rsquo;m sorry that you were cheated as my previous attempts of love were untreated as everything happens for a reason, canon events, makes us grow and ascend as you are my Mary Jane and Gwen at the same time but you are yourself which I love the most I know we&amp;rsquo;re not perfect but no one is your the reason why I keep pushing and why life is so beautiful to live I see why now this love is so unbound</description>

      <description>this tension is building up inside of me
to the point where I donâ€™t know how to explain it within me
something about us sparked a flame that I would never forget
too bad we never commit, I think deep down is what we regret
I just wanna hug you tight
fight for you right by your side
close off the outside world
as we run in the beautiful night</description>
