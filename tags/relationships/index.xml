      <description>here we are
my scars turned into actual Love Stars
this time,
it isn&amp;rsquo;t love that is unrequited
but it&amp;rsquo;s very alive and excited
like a hero in the night skyscraper
I want to take that leap of faith
and become greater
maybe soulmates aren&amp;rsquo;t found
but are created
it was worth the pain and the waiting
I know we&amp;rsquo;re scared
you&amp;rsquo;ve promised that you&amp;rsquo;ll never hurt me
and never abandon or flee</description>

      <description>Going through the Dark Night of the Soul, can sometimes feel pretty scary&amp;hellip; the way that we&amp;rsquo;ve perceived life is crumbling before our eyes. Everything from what we believed is to be to being revealed what the truth is either in our personal lives or looking what society is. All of these multiple factors were the reason why the Dark Night of the Soul happened to me. But why does this happen in the first place anyways?</description>

      <description>this tension is building up inside of me
to the point where I donâ€™t know how to explain it within me
something about us sparked a flame that I would never forget
too bad we never commit, I think deep down is what we regret
I just wanna hug you tight
fight for you right by your side
close off the outside world
as we run in the beautiful night</description>

      <description>I keep running away from the things that I need to face, being attached on with the past and I can&amp;rsquo;t run and hide forever. Made a lot of mistakes with that connection that could&amp;rsquo;ve been something but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t mean&amp;rsquo;t to be. I&amp;rsquo;m still learning on how to move forward from it, which is still a challenge for me, reminsing about the times I had with her, mourning on what I lost.</description>
