      <description>The more I reflect, thinking deep about it ever since this whole world changed, I&amp;rsquo;m now questioning within this system&amp;rsquo;s ego, my ego, and everyone elses. I see pass through it now, the way this world conditioned us within a tradition, something that the system raise and taught us to do since begining of schooling, which is to make money. But why though? The one thing out of everythung within this system that is keeping us stuck here, staying comfortable and not fight for whats going on in this Matrix.</description>
