      <description>Going through the Dark Night of the Soul, can sometimes feel pretty scary&amp;hellip; the way that we&amp;rsquo;ve perceived life is crumbling before our eyes. Everything from what we believed is to be to being revealed what the truth is either in our personal lives or looking what society is. All of these multiple factors were the reason why the Dark Night of the Soul happened to me. But why does this happen in the first place anyways?</description>

      <description>From when we were born, we were taught things that were false and many lies that I still see people believing, and even myself.
What I&amp;rsquo;m talking about most importantly in this post, which we will focus on and the most thing that many people seem to struggle and get the wrong idea about on how to be free from this trap with the many fear and psychological traps of today day in age of shoving sexual media in our faces and porn.</description>

      <description>The more I reflect, thinking deep about it ever since this whole world changed, I&amp;rsquo;m now questioning within this system&amp;rsquo;s ego, my ego, and everyone elses. I see pass through it now, the way this world conditioned us within a tradition, something that the system raise and taught us to do since begining of schooling, which is to make money. But why though? The one thing out of everythung within this system that is keeping us stuck here, staying comfortable and not fight for whats going on in this Matrix.</description>
