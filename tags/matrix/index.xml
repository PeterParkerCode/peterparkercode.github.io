      <description>Going through the Dark Night of the Soul, can sometimes feel pretty scary&amp;hellip; the way that we&amp;rsquo;ve perceived life is crumbling before our eyes. Everything from what we believed is to be to being revealed what the truth is either in our personal lives or looking what society is. All of these multiple factors were the reason why the Dark Night of the Soul happened to me. But why does this happen in the first place anyways?</description>

      <description>The days between Kim Jong-hyun death to moon bin his exactly 74 months apart
Like how 47 the reflection of 74 as Suicide = 47
Moon bin = 107
Ritual Sacrifice = 107
The concert Moonbin was supposed to attend called Dream Concert equals to 56 and 205 as he died at the age of 25
The record label that Astro is with Fatagio equates to 44 like kill = 44 in gematria and how he died on a Wednesday equating to 44 in the same Reverse Reduction</description>

      <description>From when we were born, we were taught things that were false and many lies that I still see people believing, and even myself.
What I&amp;rsquo;m talking about most importantly in this post, which we will focus on and the most thing that many people seem to struggle and get the wrong idea about on how to be free from this trap with the many fear and psychological traps of today day in age of shoving sexual media in our faces and porn.</description>

      <description>The more I reflect, thinking deep about it ever since this whole world changed, I&amp;rsquo;m now questioning within this system&amp;rsquo;s ego, my ego, and everyone elses. I see pass through it now, the way this world conditioned us within a tradition, something that the system raise and taught us to do since begining of schooling, which is to make money. But why though? The one thing out of everythung within this system that is keeping us stuck here, staying comfortable and not fight for whats going on in this Matrix.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I knew I couldn&amp;rsquo;t kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But if I could get them to kill eachother&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; - Zemo. SEE THROUGH THE ILLUSION AND THE AGENDA THAT IS BEING WAGED ON US. All of these hate crimes on the news and mainstream is to DIVIDE AND CONQUER US. They dont want us coming TOGETHER as a community and putting our differences to the side! If that were to happen, we&amp;rsquo;ll be too powerful than these higher ups and puppet on a string!</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;This is Emmet. And he was just like all of you. A face in the crowd, following the same instructions as you. He was so good at fitting in, no one ever saw him. And I owe you an apology, because I used to look down on people like that. Because it turns out Emmet had great ideas. And if they seemed weird, and kind of pointless, they actually came closer than anyone else to saving the universe.</description>
