      <description>here we are
my scars turned into actual Love Stars
this time,
it isn&amp;rsquo;t love that is unrequited
but it&amp;rsquo;s very alive and excited
like a hero in the night skyscraper
I want to take that leap of faith
and become greater
maybe soulmates aren&amp;rsquo;t found
but are created
it was worth the pain and the waiting
I know we&amp;rsquo;re scared
you&amp;rsquo;ve promised that you&amp;rsquo;ll never hurt me
and never abandon or flee</description>

      <title>Going through the Dark Night of The Soul. Why is this Happening?</title>

      <description>Going through the Dark Night of the Soul, can sometimes feel pretty scary&amp;hellip; the way that we&amp;rsquo;ve perceived life is crumbling before our eyes. Everything from what we believed is to be to being revealed what the truth is either in our personal lives or looking what society is. All of these multiple factors were the reason why the Dark Night of the Soul happened to me. But why does this happen in the first place anyways?</description>

      <description>The days between Kim Jong-hyun death to moon bin his exactly 74 months apart
Like how 47 the reflection of 74 as Suicide = 47
Moon bin = 107
Ritual Sacrifice = 107
The concert Moonbin was supposed to attend called Dream Concert equals to 56 and 205 as he died at the age of 25
The record label that Astro is with Fatagio equates to 44 like kill = 44 in gematria and how he died on a Wednesday equating to 44 in the same Reverse Reduction</description>

      <description>From when we were born, we were taught things that were false and many lies that I still see people believing, and even myself.
What I&amp;rsquo;m talking about most importantly in this post, which we will focus on and the most thing that many people seem to struggle and get the wrong idea about on how to be free from this trap with the many fear and psychological traps of today day in age of shoving sexual media in our faces and porn.</description>

      <description>About two years ago, I was in a separation with this girl that I liked, which was sadly cut off too shortly after major agendas were taking place around the world. A lot of grief, mourning, heartbreak took place with a lot elephants in the room needing to be addressed between me and her, as I tried to reach out to her, though she became very distant, closed off and avoided me.</description>

      <description>This show signal handily helped me so much when going through life. Throughout this show, we see Eli who was an introvert, hated himself, and was constantly bullied by his appearance with his cleft lip until he took the tough love advice from Johnny Lawrence and grabbed life by the balls and turning the tables that he has the power, while not waiting for anyone to make a change for himself.</description>

      <description>this tension is building up inside of me
to the point where I don’t know how to explain it within me
something about us sparked a flame that I would never forget
too bad we never commit, I think deep down is what we regret
I just wanna hug you tight
fight for you right by your side
close off the outside world
as we run in the beautiful night</description>

      <description>“With great power, there must also come — great responsibility.” No matter what in life, we always have a choice to make the right decisions, even if it feels like we’re forced to do said things that doesn’t resonate with us and know that is not the best option. We have the choice to not only to make the right decisions for ourselves, but for others and for the sake of the betterment of humanity.</description>

      <description>The more I reflect, thinking deep about it ever since this whole world changed, I&amp;rsquo;m now questioning within this system&amp;rsquo;s ego, my ego, and everyone elses. I see pass through it now, the way this world conditioned us within a tradition, something that the system raise and taught us to do since begining of schooling, which is to make money. But why though? The one thing out of everythung within this system that is keeping us stuck here, staying comfortable and not fight for whats going on in this Matrix.</description>

      <description>I keep running away from the things that I need to face, being attached on with the past and I can&amp;rsquo;t run and hide forever. Made a lot of mistakes with that connection that could&amp;rsquo;ve been something but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t mean&amp;rsquo;t to be. I&amp;rsquo;m still learning on how to move forward from it, which is still a challenge for me, reminsing about the times I had with her, mourning on what I lost.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I knew I couldn&amp;rsquo;t kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But if I could get them to kill eachother&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; - Zemo. SEE THROUGH THE ILLUSION AND THE AGENDA THAT IS BEING WAGED ON US. All of these hate crimes on the news and mainstream is to DIVIDE AND CONQUER US. They dont want us coming TOGETHER as a community and putting our differences to the side! If that were to happen, we&amp;rsquo;ll be too powerful than these higher ups and puppet on a string!</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;This is Emmet. And he was just like all of you. A face in the crowd, following the same instructions as you. He was so good at fitting in, no one ever saw him. And I owe you an apology, because I used to look down on people like that. Because it turns out Emmet had great ideas. And if they seemed weird, and kind of pointless, they actually came closer than anyone else to saving the universe.</description>
