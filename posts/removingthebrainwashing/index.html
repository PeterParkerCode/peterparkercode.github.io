  <p>From when we were born, we were taught things that were false and many lies that I still see people believing, and even myself.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about most importantly in this post, which we will focus on and the most thing that many people seem to struggle and get the wrong idea about on how
to be free from this trap with the many fear and psychological traps of today day in age of shoving sexual media in our faces and porn. A psychological and spiritual warfare of truth vs. lies that we were made to irrationally beLIEve. From all of my journaling, self relfections, disecting these lies and still am, I came to the conclusion how much porn is a tyrant. Now first off, what does a tyrant do? A tyrant puts fear into it&rsquo;s people, CREATES the problems, and then gives you the &ldquo;solution&rdquo;. Like throughout history of big governments creating major conflicts, blaming another group of people for it, and then having the &ldquo;justify&rdquo; excuses to invade that other territory. And this goes the same with porn. Porn createsthe problems, void, and emptyness in our lives, and gaslight us into thinking that there is something wrong with us. Society makes us think that with the many showings of sexual material on social media, movies, our peers, advertisments, that this is all normal. We think that this void must have come from somewhere else, that is problem is from the source of us. Let me give you an example. In the show <em>Spectacular Spider-Man</em>, when Peter gets the symbiote, problems, addiciton, starts popping up in his life. Peter thinks that there is something wrong with him, that this problem is being caused by him. Though in actuallity, this problem was being caused by the symbiote itself. The same exact thing with porn or any other external addiction, realize that porn CEATES the problem, and never solves it. It create like we said eariler, those empty feelings, craving for a poison that hurts us whenever wefall into that trap. It creates the many fears and false beliefs that we need it and that without it, how can we fill this &ldquo;void&rdquo;. But here is the good news. What if I told you that you were already whole? That you are enough right now in this moment. That you are already perfect, in this present as you are reading this. When I came to this truth, I felt reliefed. All this time of doing NoFap like many other people that were convinced that willpower is all we need to kick this habit. Though if NoFap/Willpower really worked, everyone will be free from porn already. But sadly, it seems like the trap keeps getting us when we distract ourselves, doing various things to keep us busy, using porn blockers though yet still finding a way around it since it has been normalize everywhere. But it&rsquo;s not removing the subconscious problem. As well with the cause of self hatred whenever we fall back into that prison, counting days/streaks which keeps us insane, in that vicious cycle.</p>
<p>There is a deeper subconscious of false beliefs, fears, any programmings that either society told us or from porn. I realize that in order to get rid of those ways of thinking, and actually recover, and be free from this poison, I needed to do the inner work and having to remind myself the truth, and I&rsquo;m still doing that. The reason why I&rsquo;m writing this is because, I still realize that there are still lingering false beliefs and fears that I have as I tripped on this path to truth of wholeness. Thankfully, I have proved to myself that I can go through life just fine as a non-addict. That it is much easier to deal with problems who is a non user of porn compared to an addict. So many things have blossomed in my lifewhen I have gained these insights. You realize when we hang out with friends or family, have a major exciting event that we are engaged in, out in public, going on trips, you never feel those false cravings from porn or any addiciton. So already, these irrational fears are being countered left and right. Once you introspect and journal to find the truth, is very freeing.</p>
<p>What we all must know is that we aren&rsquo;t quitting anything at all. Like with many willpower method that I used to believe within the NoFap community, we aren&rsquo;t sacrficing or giving soemthing up either. And truthfully I feel like NoFap is inintenally giving these false beliefs more power than it should have. The truth is, we are GAINING back our health, wealth, spirituality, love, peace of self, vitality, strength, confidence, and our life back! Like Peter Parker said when he came to the realization of the truth with the symbiote, &ldquo;You feed off of negaitive emotions, but right now, I&rsquo;m starving you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that in mind, one of the book that is still helping me remove the brainwashing, is called <em>Quit Porn Easily</em> by Celibate Yogi on Amazon, which I highly reccomend. Remember, that you are already making so much progress to getting rid of this poison in our lives. It&rsquo;s going to take time and needing to seek these truths as a Truth Seeker. Also whenever you encounter the lies like we mentioned eariler on social media, advertisments, movies, tv shows, video games, circle group, etc. remind yourself the truth and how much they are trying to sell us a false sense of pleasure that takes away the pleasure we have to live life knowing that we are whole. Really question and ask yourself why isthis being shown, or a inner fear you may have into thinking you need to take one peak, when we all know that in of itself is a lie to keep us in the trap. May your path to gaining back your birthright and freedom, and gaining back our power, be with you.</p>
